# Statevector Simulation of Quantum Circuits

This repository contains my submission for the QOSF Mentorship Program, Cohort 10, Screening Test Task 1: Statevector Simulation of Quantum Circuits. This project simulates a quantum circuit using the Hadamard gate, X gate, and CNOT gate through two methods: (i) naive simulation using matrix multiplication, and (ii) simulation using tensor multiplication. The performance of these methods is compared to highlight the efficiency and scalability of each approach.
Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Naive Simulation Using Matrix Multiplication

subtask1.py - Plot the runtime of your code as a function of the number of qubits.
